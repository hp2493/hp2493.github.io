  Census Tracts - this was my first attempt to clean the data. I joied geoids from the state wide census tract file to the city's census tract file by census tract number. I did not realize until looking at the final cleaned data that there were many repeated census tracts. I went back in to this file to write out a few clean data files.
  
  data_cleaning_2 - this file is where I finally cleaned the data and binned it into three categories to create the bivariate choropleth. 
  
  crash_data - cleaning the data from crash files.
  
  commute data - cleaning the bicycle commute data
